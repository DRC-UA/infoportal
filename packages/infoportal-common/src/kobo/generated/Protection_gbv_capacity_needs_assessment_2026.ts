    // not_hello [note] **Dear Participant**,  This survey is part of an assessment conducted by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) in Ukraine to gain a deeper understanding of the current needs, challenges, and resources of professionals involved in responding to gender-based violence (GBV), as well as those who indirectly support this work.  The assessment focuses on identifying key gaps and needs in service providers’ work, including the need for additional training, improvement of interagency coordination, strengthening support for survivors, and enhancing access to quality services. It will also analyze the level of collaboration between various structures and sectors, which is a crucial factor in establishing an effective GBV response system at the local level.  The results of this survey will serve as the basis for planning DRC’s programmatic priorities and activities in 2026, aimed at further strengthening the capacity of service providers and improving coordination in the field of GBV response.  Your responses will be used exclusively in aggregated form for the preparation of an analytical report.
