    // background/not_induction [note] The Danish Refugee Council (DRC) is launching a grant programme aimed at financing vocational training. The aim of this programme is to provide skills training and/or upgrading to improve the employability of people affected by war. The grant programme is being implemented thanks to the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. The programme is designed for residents of four regions: Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Mykolaiv and Kherson oblasts. However, priority will be given to applications from the cities of Zaporizhzhia, Kryvyi Rih, Pavlohrad, as well as Mykhailivska and Petro-Mykhailivska communities in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and Apostolivska and Tomakivska communities in Dnipropetrovska Oblast.   #####Main programme details   - The grant covers a 3-month study programme of your choice, offering financial assistance of up to USD 450.   - Enrolment/participation in the training course is from May 2024, and the course itself must be completed by the end of August 2024.   - The course is up to you. It should best suit your career aspirations.    - Once your application is approved, you will need to sign a contract with the organisation that will deliver the course.    #####Application process  1 Take note of the timeframes outlined above. Take the opportunity to fully express your motivation. Outline your employment prospects after completing the course, provide information about your family situation and articulate why you believe you should receive this grant.   Your detailed application will allow us to better understand your aspirations and make an informed decision. We currently have a limited number of places on the programme and the registration link may be closed if the maximum number of places is reached. Please note that DRC is committed to providing assistance to the most vulnerable. Expressing your interest does not mean that you will automatically be accepted into the programme.  2 Candidates will be selected based on their individual needs and vulnerabilities, motivation, skills and prospects for securing long-term employment after completing the training. After you submit your application, the DRC team will review it and, if approved, contact you to invite you for an interview. Once selected, participants will be informed of the next steps.  3 Selected candidates will receive financial support for the study programme of their choice.  4 Programme participants are required to submit a financial report detailing the expenditure of grant funds.   #####Selection criteria  To participate in the programme, you must be registered as unemployed and demonstrate interest and motivation to study. The DRC strives to provide assistance to the most vulnerable categories of the population, therefore, preference may be given to low-income individuals, large families and other vulnerable groups.    #####Filling in the application form  Please fill in the form below if you think you meet the criteria and are interested in taking the course. The form contains questions that will help us learn about your experience and motivation to learn.    Important: Registration in this form does not mean that you will be automatically selected, as the number of places is limited. The selection process will be transparent and competitive, using eligibility criteria that focus on your level of vulnerability and motivation to participate in the programme.  We expect to receive a large number of applications. Please be patient as we process your application and let you know whether you have been shortlisted or not.   If you are not selected to participate in the current vocational training grant programme, you can apply for the following programmes. For this purpose, if you give your consent, we will store your data in our database.   #####Feedback  DRC highly values any feedback related to our programmes. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact us by email: UKR-feedback@drc.ngo; or by phone: 0 800 33 95 18 (Monday-Friday, 9:00 to 17:00)
